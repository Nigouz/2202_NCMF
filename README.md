Just in case we need to update one another regarding our tool

For SpeechRecognition I had to install this in my VSCODE IDE Terminal
1. pip install SpeechRecognition
And also install the FFMPEG zip file (Sent in Tele cause idk why they dont allow files larger than 25mb here) in my computer for pydub to work
Follow this tutorial for the pydub set up [Refer to Pooja Mallam's Answer] & restart your IDE (idk if others work, but for VSCODE, it has to be restarted after his steps)

Let me know if there are other issues. 

Reference for the stt.py so far
1. https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/blob/master/API.markdown - pydub is used to help with the conversion of audio files to wav
